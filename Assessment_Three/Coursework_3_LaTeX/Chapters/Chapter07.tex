To conclude this report a short summary of the achieved goals (apart from fulfilling the requirements) should be provided:

The application was designed with a focus on modularity and a clear separation between the program logic and the database. This approach seems to have been successfully carried out.

Moreover the application tries to notify the user about all changes made (added an item to the shopping cart succeeded or failed) to allow the user a comfortable browsing experience as one would expect from a modern web page.

However, taking into account that this was the first dynamic web page developed by me, a lot of design issues still remain: even though frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Python with Django are able to provide a Model-View-Controller approach in the web world, the try to do the same in my first php project failed.

If I would redo this web page I would probably try it again, now knowing how basic interaction is achieved and how the standard setup of a php page is achieved.

However, another approach would be to use a MVC-framework.

Apart from the design issue, the application should meet the requirements and deliver a modular program.
