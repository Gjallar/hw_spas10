The testing of the application was performed in two stages:

\begin{itemize}
\item In the early development stages unit-tests were written for the base classes.
\item After chaining the application parts together, the applications correct behaviour was mainly tested by using the application. This was necessary as unit-testing \ac{GUI} and multi-threaded code is extremely difficult.
\end{itemize}

The source-code of the written unit-tests can be seen in \autoref{ap:tests}.

To run the test-cases the \href{http://www.nunit.org/}{NUnit}-framework (\url{http://www.nunit.org/}) is needed.

The test-cases cover the passing of different types of parameters.

A short list shall be provided:
