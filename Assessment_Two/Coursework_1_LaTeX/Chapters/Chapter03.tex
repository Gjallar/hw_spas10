This chapter provides a general overview of the application's design without explaining implementation details.

Therefore, it will provide a general overview of the application's architecture and point out areas of interest in the design: these areas will describe the reasons the current approach has been chosen. If appropriate, the design patterns that were employed will be mentioned and described. Concrete implementation details will later be described in \autoref{ch:developer_guide}.

\section{Architectural overview}
\label{sec:architectural_overview}

The application was built with the \ac{MVP} pattern in mind as a basis for the architecture\footnote{Further information about the \ac{MVP} pattern can be found at \href{http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc188690.aspx}{\ac{MVP}-Pattern} (\url{http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc188690.aspx})}.

This way the program logic can be separated from the display logic. To achieve this, the view passes all method-calls needed due to user interaction to the presenter. The presenter routes them to the model if necessary. 

All return values will then be passed back to the presenter. The presenter will then decide what action the view needs to take according to the received values. These action will be communicated to the view via an interface the view needs to implement.

This leads to a \textbf{decoupling} between the view and the model and allows the presenter to be reusable across multiple views, as a new view only has to implement the interface as well to fulfil the \textit{contract} with the presenter.

A visualisation of this pattern looks like this:

\end{center}
\end{figure}

This diagram already shows the possibility of the division into two distinct projects:

\begin{description}
\item[GUI:] Hosts the \ac{GUI} implemented in WinForms. This includes all display-related logic: performing actions based on events, displaying and hiding controls, responding to user interaction.
\item[Logic:] Hosts the \textit{business}-logic, the interfaces and the presenters.
\end{description}

As can already be inferred from the short description, most of the application's logic is based in the logic project, which (excluding the view interfaces) encompasses the following classes:

\end{center}
\end{figure}

While implementing the application certain high-level design decisions were made that shall be described in the following two paragraphs.

\section{Separate change}
\label{subsec:separate_change}

The first decision made was to separate changes in distinct classes as much as possible: to achieve this layers of abstraction have been implemented between the presenter and the concrete data classes.

These layers of abstraction are implemented in the classes \texttt{FavouriteHandler} and \texttt{HistoryHandler}.
From a design point-of-view, they provide the presenters that are utilizing them with a facade to the data-classes \texttt{History} and \texttt{Favourite}.

To centralize changes and prevent data loss due to multiple handlers (e.g. multiple presenter hold a reference to a different HistoryHandler - thus modifying different histories), both objects were implemented via the \texttt{Singleton} pattern, ensuring only one object is present at any given time. This way all presenters will modify the same data.

Moreover the handler classes implement an \texttt{Observer} pattern to notify the relevant presenters about any changes that occur in the data. 
This way the presenter can ensure that the view is always displaying accurate data. 
This approach was necessary, as the \texttt{PagePresenter} and the \texttt{HistoryPresenter} both operate on the history-data: the \texttt{PagePresenter} adds every visited page to the history, whereas the \texttt{HistoryPresenter} ensures that the History is displayed in the view.

The same principle applies in the case of the \texttt{FavouritePresenter} and the \texttt{FavouritesPresenter}. The first one adds and edits one single \texttt{Favourite}, whereas the second presenter handles the display of multiple \texttt{Favourite}s and the provides the necessary logic for deleting \texttt{Favourite}s.

\section{Loose coupling}
\label{subsec:loose_coupling}

To provide a loosely coupled application that may be enhanced with little effort at a later time, the communication between distinct logical groups in the application was implemented via interfaces.

The logical groups (that are not denoted separately in the projects) are:

\begin{itemize}
\item The View: Realized in a separate project.
\item The Business Logic: Realized in the logic project.
\item The Persistence Logic: Realized in the logic project in the classes \texttt{ISerialiser} and the concrete implementations of the interface.
\end{itemize}

As already shown in the \ac{MVP} pattern the presenter $\longleftrightarrow$ view communication is decoupled via interfaces.
Moreover the logic $\longleftrightarrow$ persistence communication is decoupled via the \texttt{ISerialiser} interface as well.

This will allow a change in the persistence logic without affecting the business logic (for further details see \autoref{subsubsec:serialisation}).

\section{Threading}
\label{subsec:threading}

To fulfil the requirements \texttt{AR01} and \texttt{AR02} multi threading was introduced in the application when a web-page is requested.

Therefore the request will be carried out in an \texttt{asynchronous} thread.

As the view should not be concerned about concrete implementation choices, the decision was made, to introduce multi-threading in the \ac{logic} project. 
Inside this project, it is implemented in the \texttt{TextPage}-presenter. 
This way the application will not loose one of its core-functions should the customer decide to exchange the \ac{GUI}.
Moreover the presenter was chosen to implement the multithreading logic, as all the logical classes did not seem viable to provide the threading functionality. 
By applying the principle that each object should \textit{do one thing well}, the \texttt{PageHandler}-class seemed an ill-fit, as it already provided the functionality to request web-pages. 

As a consequence, the presenter - that already manages the flow of information through the application - seemed a better and more fitting candidate to handle the flow of multi-threaded information as well.

Apart from changes to the presenter, certain alterations had to be implemented in the \ac{GUI} to support multi-threading in a WinForms application (see \autoref{subsubsec:view} for the details): should the \ac{GUI} be exchanged these problems might need to be taken into account again.
